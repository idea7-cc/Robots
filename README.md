# Idea7 TEC Bots
This repo is for all of the TEC Bot series Idea7 Robots.  Robots prior to the creation of this repo may be added in time.  New TEC Bots and support files will be maintained here.

The TEC Bot series started as a spin-off of the series of robot kits that were being created by TEC Hub Foundation for Virginia Space Flight Academy's Advanced Robotics Camp.  When Cornell University added a new robotics course to their Summer College line-up, the TEC Bot series was a natural choice.
